 #TNO_OPENING_DESC:0 "Welcome to The New Order: Old World Blues! Old World Blues is a demo for The New Order: Last Days of Europe and much smaller in scope than the released mod will be. In this demo, you will be able to fully enjoy four nations: The noble Ural League, the proud communes of Orenburg, the foul bandits of the Dirlewanger Brigade, and the ever-plotting Lysenko of Magnitogorsk.\n\nYou will find these nations fully playable for a bit over five years, primarily for the duration that they are all killing one another. The New Order does not play like many other mods, and is as a narrative experience as much as it is a gameplay one, though you will find the Southern Urals to be fairly gameplay driven regardless.\n\nAll other nations in the mod have had their content removed for the purposes of this demo. However, you will notice the world still changing as the demo progress, giving you hints at what else is to come!\n\nIf you are interested in the mod and like what you see here, please like and favorite the mod, and check us out on social media! You can find links to our Discord, Reddit, and several other sites on the main menu, as well from our Steam page.\n\nThe New Order has been created due to the tireless efforts of numerous developers, contributors, artists, writers, moderators, and a plucky composer. I started this mod over five years ago now, originally for Victoria 2, and it was a very different mod then. Now, for almost two years, me and my team have tirelessly been turning The New Order from a little pet project into something we can all truly be proud of. Over two hundred people have at some point contributed to our project, not counting the numerous donations of work and time given to us by our friends in the HOI4 Modding Coop and beyond, an organization I helped found and am proud to stand by to this day.\n\nWe have faced numerous challenges, but have been blessed with a community that has stood with us through it all. For their patience, dedication, and love, we wanted to reward them and give something back. To our beautiful community, this is for you. Thank you all so much. We are humbled every day just thinking of the great expectations and the amazing support you have given us.\n\nThank you everyone, and please enjoy the demo! There is so much more to come from us, and we hope you will be there along the ride!\n\n~ThePinkPanzer, Lead Developer.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

 COUNTRY_INFO_VYATKA: "§G==THE PRINCIPALITY OF VYATKA==§!\n\nThe near-total collapse of Soviet authority in the wake of the West Russian War has, over the years, resulted in all manner of ambitious warlords rising through the ashes and staking their claim to Russia. One such group is a ghost from Russia's turbulent past: the remnants of the Romanov dynasty led by §WVladimir III§! and his allies.\n\nDuring the West Russian War, the hard-pressed German forces allowed a division of European émigrés loyal to the exiled §WVladimir Kirillovich§! to join the fight against the resurgent §RRed Army§!, where they would play a key role in a desperate Wehrmacht offensive. Although the Germans were eventually forced to withdraw, the monarchists pushed on regardless, and were able to establish a permanent foothold in §WVyatka§!. Now §WVladimir III§! and the émigré cliques oversee the strongest bastion of monarchism in Russia. That being said, §WVyatka§! is beginning to face internal divisions. The émigré cliques bicker amongst themselves and compete for political dominance, while the antiquated bureaucracy of the §WPrincipality§! continues to cause problems as time marches on. The Okhrana, the §WPrincipality's§! secret police led by Boris Smyslovsky, has so far been successful in ensuring stability for the regime, but the question of how much power they should wield remains. These issues will need to be addressed before any serious plans for reclamation can begin.\n\nInternally, the §WPrincipality§! is divided between three émigré cliques of equal import. Firstly are the Constitutional Democrats, led by the émigré §WRoman Gul§!, who represent the liberals. They wish to create a functioning constitutional monarchy, complete with guaranteed rights for minorities. Secondly, the Solidarists led by §WAleksandr Solzhenitsyn§! are staunch nationalists with some authoritarian tendencies. That being said, they still wish for some degree of reform from the antiquated systems of yesteryear. Finally, there is §WVasily Shulgin's§! faction, the All-Russian National Union. §WShulgin§! is a politician of the old school, with a history of service dating back to the days of Tsar Nicholas II. Like the liberals, he favors constitutionalism as well, but does not wish to disrupt the traditions of the old Empire.\n\nExternally, §WVyatka§! is surrounded by potential threats. To the southeast, the madmen of the §RAryan Brotherhood§! serve as the most pressing threat. In the north, the unstable §RRepublic of Komi§! is unpredictable and should be carefully monitored, while the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! stirs. If §WVyatka§! is to unite Russia, conflict with them is inevitable. Meanwhile, raids from the §RTatar§! and §RBashkir§! warlords to the west and south are common but are unlikely to escalate into a full-blown conflict for now. Further to the southwest, however, is §RAndrey Vlasov§! and the so-called §RRussian Liberation Army§! based in §RSamara§!. Unlike the §RTatars§!, they harbor ambitions of expansion and may cause problems in the future if left unchecked. To the east lies the warlords of §GBerezniki§! and §GGayny§!. Although §GBerezniki§! pledges their resources to us, their governor may have ambitions of his own. On the other hand, relations with §GGayny§! have mostly been cordial, and it may be possible to sway them to the cause.\n\nThe §WPrincipality of Vyatka§! now stands poised to undertake the arduous task of uniting Russia once and for all. Will Russia find itself ruled by a Tsar once more? Only time will tell...\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* Decide between constitutionalism or the old government.\n\n* Prepare the §WPrincipality's§! armies for conflict with rival warlords.\n\n* Unify the §WRussian Empire§! once more."

 COUNTRY_INFO_SAMARA: "§G==THE COMMITTEE FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA==§!\n\nIn the bloodiest days of the West Russian War, when it seemed like the Reich's hold on Russia was on the verge of slipping forever, the German high command turned to desperate means to stave off the collapse of their front line. Drawn from a range of auxiliary colonial militias of Russian conscripts that were meant to police German-held Russia, the §WRussian Liberation Army§! or §WROA§! was created. In propaganda, the §WROA§! was depicted as a proud Russian army, fighting the §Rbolshevik§! menace of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§!. In desperation, the Germans even allowed the creation of the §WCommittee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia§!, or §WKONR§!, as the embryo of a free Russian Republic that would rule over areas liberated by the German counter offensives.\n\nReality was much less flattering to the §WROA§!. Its leader §WAndrey Vlasov§!, a former Red Army general, was nothing more than a puppet of the Wehrmacht's high command. His officers were a a disjointed bunch. Many were also captured Red Army officers, preferring to join the §WROA§! than die in a German POW camp. Others were fascist émigrés, joining the §WROA§! on a great crusade to defeat §RBolshevism§!. The common soldiers were desperate cannon fodder, drafted at gunpoint by the Germans and sent to reinforce the most desperate sectors of the front. Far from being welcomed as liberators, Russian people caught in the conflict area welcomed §WROA§! soldiers with rock and insults.\n\nDespite all this, the §WROA§! pushed on. The soldiers fought with the energy of desperation, and managed to help turn the tide in the sector around §WSamara§!. Soon the §WROA§! found itself beyond the German lines, freed from their former taskmasters. With the war winding down and the §RWRRF§! in retreat, the Germans wrote off their cannon fodder as mutinous Slav Untermensch. The new headquarters of the §WROA§! in Samara were not spared any of the terror bombing campaigns that followed.\n\nSince then the §WROA§! has huddled in Samara, having traded one prison for another. Unable to expand their area of control by the terror bombings, and forbidden to go back home in the west, the common soldiers of the army have languished for the better part of a decade in their garrisons. The §WROA's§! officers, meanwhile, have grown weary of §WVlasov's§! indecisiveness. They argue for a more decentralized leadership, and for the abandonment of §WKONR's§! original democratic mission in favor of a continuation of the §WROA's§! junta. Using general §WSergei Bunyachenko§! as their mouthpiece, the men of the Officer's Committee scheme to take advantage of §WVlasov's§! apathy and old age. However the officers are not all united in ideology. Quite a few have formed a pro-democracy faction, and argue that §WVlasov's§! heir as chairman of §WKONR§! should be §WMiletiy Zykov§!, a former journalist that has maneuvered his way into being the chief propagandist of the §WROA's§! regime in Samara. Zykov argues for the continued struggle to liberate Russia from §RBolshevism§! as well as German oppression. In between all this, many common soldiers and lower ranking officers have grown tired of the high command's bickering and seek to follow General §WOktan's§! goal to use the §WROA§! to build a strong, fascist state... and to enrich the soldiers in the process.\n\nThe §WROA§! is at a crossroad. Loathed by all their neighbors as German collaborators, yet feared for their veteran army and iron discipline, the men of the §WROA§! await the end of the terror bombing. Some seek to redeem their honor by rebuilding Russia. Others seek vengeance on the communists and on the Germans who have ruined their life. Finally, a growing minority simply want to lash out at the uncaring world that has forced them to lose a decade holed in Samara.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Determine who shall win the power struggle to be the successor of §WVlasov§! as leader of the §WROA§!.\n\n*Finish what the Germans could not do and destroy the §RWRRF§! once and for all.\n\n*Show the world the perils of underestimating the so-called "traitorous dogs of the ROA.""
 
 COUNTRY_INFO_1_NIK:0 "§G==THE KOMI REPUBLIC==§!\n\nThe failures of §RNikolai Bukharin§!, the §RGerman§! invasion, and the defeat of the §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§! against the §RGerman Reich§! bled the people of Russia far too much, subjecting them to unimaginable horror and destitution for little gain. Rather than the worker's utopia promised by the §RSoviet government§!, the communist experiment ended in failure, as apocalyptic warfare scorched West Russia for the second time in two decades.\n\nThe former government of the §GKomi ASSR§!, a faithful band of Soviet loyalist politicians, gladly went along with §RGrand Marshal Kliment Voroshilov§!'s plans for the restoration of the §RSoviet government§!, and Komi, despite the reservations that its highly politically deviant population held, gladly slipped into the pocket of the §RFront§!, until the West Russian War, and the transition of the §RFront§!'s capital to Syktyvkar.\n\nThe War, the political failures of the §RFront§!, the final assassination of Alexei Rykov, and the bombing of the §RPresidium of the West Russian Revolutionary Front§! marked the last straw for the Komi government, however. §GNikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky§!, the newly appointed head of the §GKomi ASSR§!, took executive action to declare independence from the §RFront§!, being aided in his operation by a slew of former §RWRRF§! politicians, including §xMikhail Andreyevich Suslov§!, foreign minister of the Front, and §SAndrey Alexandrovich Zhdanov§!, a prominent official of the ComIntern.\n\nWith the secession of the §GKomi ASSR§! from the §RFront§! under a newly declared §GRepublic§!, and the loss of yet another capital, the political cohesion of the §RFront§! dissolved, and more and more separatists ate away at the §RWRRF§!'s armies before operations could be launched to put down the rebellions and warlords.\n\nWith the democratic nature of the §GKomi Republic§! becoming well-known throughout West Russia, and the developed city of Syktyvkar becoming swollen with refugees from other, less accommodating warlord states, a climate of political radicalism began to fester within the §GRepublic§!, fed by §GVoznesensky§!'s collaboration with §SZhdanov§!'s communists, and the underground influence of §Rextremist politicians§! who had been set free from the many former GULAGs in the region. Political violence, grand scheming, and paramilitary activity became commonplace, with the corruption within the §GRepublic§!'s armed forces doing nothing to help matters, despite the efforts of talented officers such as §GPetro Grigorenko§! and §GIvan Korolkov§!.\n\n§YThe State of the Komi Republic:§!\nThe state of the §GRepublic§! in 1962 is hardly one conducive to functional democracy, or civilized life. Crime is at a recent high, with constant paramilitary street battles shattering the silence on the streets of Syktyvkar. The plots of shadowy ideologues are constantly pit against each other, in the form of assassinations, thefts, fraud, assault, extortion, and conspiracy against the Republic. While power is brokered within the §GNational Assembly§!, and the §G"Democratic Coalition"§! of relatively centrist parties attempts to keep order and sane governance, §xMikhail Suslov§!'s §xCommunist Party of Komi§! on the far left and §OLev Gumilyov§!'s §OPassionariyy Organization§! on the far right constantly attempt to bring down the government in the shadows, while maintaining a respectable public opinion.\n\n§YThe Players of the Game:§!\nThe §GKomi Republic§!'s politicians are infamous for a particular nature that seems to run through the §GRepublic§! as a whole - a pseudo-addiction to scheming, backstabbing, and power games. Regardless of whether they personally tolerate such underhanded tactics, the environment of the §GRepublic§! demands such tendencies, and so, the politicians which survive this unimaginably stressful environment tend to be forged into metaphorical diamonds - master schemers and maneuverers who can manipulate entire parties beneath their thumb.\n\n§BThe Centre:§!\nDespite the wide variety of democratic parties and the issues which cleave movements apart in Komi, the saving grace of the §GRepublic§! is that democracy, too, is a political question and hot-button topic. The intensity of the efforts to tear down democracy has forged the otherwise disparate centrist parties into a ramshackle coalition to preserve the electoral system at all costs, and fight radicalism. The ruling §PPeople's Democratic Socialist Party (DSNP)§!, §MUnion of Young Reformers (SMR)§!, and §gSovereign Democratic Party (PSD)§! have all become tempered allies in the environment of the §GRepublic§!.\n\n§PNikolai Alekseevich Voznesensky:§!\nThe §GPresident of the Republic§! and leader of the §PPeople's Democratic Socialist Party§! since its founding, §PNikolai Voznesensky§! is a rather controversial man. Despite his initial electoral popularity, his constant scandals, often revolving around his abrasiveness, racist comments, or allegations of corruption, have eroded his popularity and cast many members of his party into an unfavorable public light. His friendship with the communist leader §SAndrei Zhdanov§! has come under scrutiny in recent months, and it only remains to be seen whether the 1963 election shall be the end of §PVozesensky§!'s political career, or merely the start of his next term."
 
 COUNTRY_INFO_2_NIK:0 "§MAlexei Nikolayevich Kosygin:§!\nA prominent elected Deputy, and leader of the §MUnion of Young Reformers§!, §MAlexei Kosygin§! is famed as a rather quiet and respectful politician, who serves as the chief "peacemaker" within the center. However, his disillusionment with the current composition of the §GCoalition§! is growing with each and every new scandal §PVoznesensky§! finds himself in, and he constantly finds himself looking at his own potential bid for power. Along with his close friend, §gSvetlana Stalina§!, §MKosygin§! forms the "hardline" wing of the centrist coalition - the wing that will never allow for capitulation to the radicals.\n\n§gSvetlana Iosifovna Stalina:§!\nA former §PDSNP§! member who split to form the §gSovereign Democratic Party§! following yet another infamous scandal, §gSvetlana Stalina§! is a rather young and idealistic firebrand who has overcome her reputation as a splitter, and cut out a position as a force in her own right. §gStalina§! forms the trustworthy right flank of the coalition, with a platform that combines a patriotic, security-centered policy with a strong focus on welfare and public works. Her constant praise of institutional power and stability, as well as her desire to stabilize the foundation of the §GRepublic§! by any means necessary, has led to constant accusations of authoritarianism, but her coalition partners tend to dismiss these claims. After all, §gStalina§! is utterly uncompromising - in her eyes, a strong, democratic §GRussian Free Republic§! is worth the cost - no matter how painful the means are to get there.\n\n§xThe Left:§!\nThe §xCommunist Party of Komi§! is notable in that it is the most united political "wing" in the Republic. The infamous §xMikhail Suslov§! has forged an ironclad political machine out of the far left, leading successful operation after operation to stage scandals, shatter the people's confidence in the government, and establish an environment of constant pressure on the §GRepublic§!'s security forces. However, despite its unity, not all is well within the §xCommunist Party§!. The cracks between its leaders are invisible in public, but all too apparent behind closed doors. In the eyes of Party insiders, a conflict between §xMikhail Suslov§! and §rIvan Serov§!'s orthodox faction and §SAndrei Zhdanov§! and §lSvetlana Bukharina§!'s reformist faction is inevitable - all that remains to be seen is how destructive it shall be to the §xParty§!'s very foundations.\n\n§xMikhail Andreyevich Suslov:§!\nThe stories that one would hear of Komi's infamous "shadow master", §xMikhail Suslov§!, are awe-inspiring, and wide in scope. According to various citizens of the §GRepublic§!, §xSuslov§! is personally behind nearly every aspect of the chaos in Komi, personally orchestrating street battles, robberies, and blackmailing rings while he plays the violin in his townhouse. Not every story is true, of course, but §xSuslov§!'s reputation speaks for itself.\n\nA famed leader within the WRRF with such a fearful political reputation that §RMikhail Tukhachevsky§! condemned him for couping the government without any evidence, §xSuslov§! has maintained his talents throughout the Russian wasteland, honing them more and more as his career advances. §xSuslov§! is a brilliant man who views the §GRepublic§! as his chessboard - a complex machine made up of interlocking mechanisms of class conflict and civil strife. With every move of his paramilitaries and "unaffiliated" Deputies in the §GNational Assembly§!, he comes closer and closer to his goal - the end of the §GRepublic§!, and the restoration of the §RUSSR§!, with himself as the grey cardinal behind it all.\n\n§SAndrei Alexandrovich Zhdanov:§!\n§SAndrei Zhdanov§! is a walking contradiction. He is the leader of the §xCommunist Party§!'s §GNational Assembly§! delegation, and one of the highest figures in the Party - yet his libertarianism and populism seems to fly in the face of what §xSuslov§! is widely considered to want. §SZhdanov§! is a visionary in every way, a fierce, charismatic firebrand - yet he tends to align with §PVoznesensky§!'s government constantly, seemingly missing opportunities to perpetuate the §RRevolution§! that the §xCommunist Party§! so desires. The mystery behind §SZhdanov§!'s motivations and operations raise many questions, but none can doubt his character. According to many centrists across the aisle, if one Communist were to take power, it would have to be §SZhdanov§!. After all... where else could one find such charming, moderate, populist spirit?\n\n§lSvetlana Nikolaevna Bukharina:§!\nThe emergence of the daughter of the doomed §RNikolai Bukharin§! within the §GRepublic§! was hardly expected, but it was hailed by many communists as a sign that their movement was destined for greatness comparable to the strength of the old §RVKP(b)§!. §lSvetlana Bukharina§! rapidly rose into the ranks of the §xCommunist Party§!, being elected by unheard-of margins, bringing her unstoppable energy and ambition with her. Despite her comparative youth compared to many figures within the government, and her questionable adherence to the letter of the line that §xSuslov§! promotes within the §xParty§!, §lBukharina§! is most certainly one of the foremost communists within the §GRepublic§! - and the brightest, most radiant rising star among their number."
 
 COUNTRY_INFO_3_NIK:0 "§YThe Right:§!\nThe §OPassionariyy Organization§! is a singularly bizarre organization in Komi, a combination of a social club, a secret society, and an apparatus for political coalition-building. Under the wide-spanning umbrella of the §OPassionariyy§! are Eurasianists, "compassionate conservatives", monarchists, and other, smaller movements, all united solely by the desire for a new, right-wing path for the §GRepublic§!. The §OPassionariyy§! are easily the most wide-ranging coalition in Komi, stretching to every possible corner of right-wing thought, and, as of such, paradoxically both prone to infighting, and extremely effective at operating within the §GRepublic§!. Within the §OPassionariyy§!, there is someone for everyone, or so it is said - the media outlets controlled by the organization appeal to the people, rallies are held, and the §Gcenter coalition§! is forced to look closer and closer towards §OPassionariyy§!-affiliated politicians each day.\n\n§OLev Nikolayevich Gumilyov:§!\nThere is only one man in the §GRepublic§! with the cunning and political acumen to unite so many disparate rightist groups under one banner, and his name is §OLev Gumilyov§!. An eccentric philosopher and a well-spoken ideologue, §OGumilyov§! is the ideological heart of the §OPassionariyy Organization§!... and the brain, as well. His theories of a Eurasian civilizational empire are ones that most of the Komi right can at least pretend to get behind, and his ideals of rapid expansionism, the restoration of national strength, and a culture of patriotism appeal to the teeming multitudes that attend his rallies. Despite his seemingly unthinkable level of extremism, §OGumilyov§! is the center of the §OPassionariyy§! in spirit, and he will not halt his shadowy operations until his theories may be tested and realized on the grandest scale imaginable.\n\n§YIgor Rostislavovich Shafarevich:§!\nEvery movement needs a face, and §YIgor Shafarevich§! is a respectable face indeed. A well-respected academic in the §GRepublic§!, §YShafarevich§! heads the moderate "moralist" wing of the §OPassionariyy§! - the wing most keyed to gathering public support, and the support of the centrists within the §GNational Assembly§!. §YShafarevich§! is one of the most famous voices of the §OPassionariyy§!, and his calls for a "National Democracy" based off of "compassionate conservative" principles are heard around the §GRepublic§!, on widespread venues such as Radio Free Syktyvkar, the pre-eminent broadcasting service within the §GRepublic§!. As the left grows larger and more threatening, Shafarevich's commitment to democracy and willingness to cooperate with the Centre has driven more and more politicians amongst the right-wing of the ruling coalition to look his way, seeking deliverance from the communist threat.\n\n§jSergey Vladimirovich Taboritsky:§!\nThe black horse of Komi, the enigmatic §jSergey Taboritsky§! is famous as an almost anachronistic figure. His Imperial regalia, his nostalgic calls for the restoration of the §RRussian Empire§!, and his vast hidden personal wealth may, in a different state, tear the people away from supporting him, but in Komi, it merely serves to captivate the imagination. §jTaboritsky§! is quite possibly the most populist of the §OPassionariyy§!, tirelessly campaigning for his §jOVRI§! - the §jSociety for the Restoration of the Russian Empire§!. However, among those who have spent time close to him, it has become apparent that something is very, very wrong with §jTaboritsky§! - the look in his eyes is not quite that of a man driven by sheerly mortal energy, and his mannerisms have consistently grown more bizarre...\n\n==FEATURES==\n\n*Fight through the storm of intrigue to save the §GRepublic§!... or bring it §Rcrashing down§!.\n\n*Experiment with the many ideologies and parties present within the §GRepublic§!, and bring one to victory.\n\n*Put an end to §Rwarlordism and anarchy§!, uniting Russia under the flag of one of Komi's many contenders."

The §RWest Russian Revolutionary Front§ !remnants of the Red Army in Western Russia, nearly managed to derail Germany's new order in Europe. Once the dust had settled, the §GFinnish Republic§! found its eastern border occupied by the remnants of the §RWRRF§!. Looking only to themselves for safety, Finland turned to...

Ворошиловград был освобожден на 28 день операции, что привело к попытке государственного переворота со стороны §RСС§! §RГенриха Гиммлера§!. На 40 день наступления, пока в рядах захватчиков царили расприи, §GКрасная Армия§! подошла к окраинам Ленинграда и Москвы.\n\nНо вдруг баланс сил переломился в противоположную сторону.

Точная причина §Rраспада§! §WЗРРФ§! в ходе §RЗападнорусской войны§! неизвестна, существуют лишь теории: кто-то говорит о попытках §RСуслова§! захватить власть, другие упоминают критически разросшуюся численность офицерского состава. Столкнувшись с угрозой потери §GВерховного командования§! из-за §Rнемецкого контрнаступления§! и помощь коллаборационистов из §RРусской Освободительной Армии§! и клики §RВладимира Романова§!, маршалы и генералы вынуждено эвакуировались в Сыктывкар.

После катастрофического провала §Rоперации Суворов§! между полководцами возникли серьезные разногласия. На юге находятся военные округа §WПлесецк§! и §WУхта§!, якобы верные подчиненные Фронта, которым поручено обеспечивать защиту от §Rнемецких бомбардировок§! и добывать нефть. Однако цель у этих территорий иная - удержать §GТухачевского§! и §GЖукова§! с их фракциями подальше от руководства в Архангельске.\n\nМаршалы §GМихаил Николаевич Тухачевский§! и §GГеоргий Константинович Жуков§! являются двумя основными кандидатами на роль преемника §GВрошилова§! после его §Rсмерти§!;\n\n§GТухачевский§! талантливый, но несколько эксцентричный генерал, который верит в роль §GКрасной Армии§! как главного двигателя политических изменений. Бывший дворянин, который отверг свой класс и присоединился к большевикам в ходе §GГражданской войны§!, §GТухачевский§! получил поддержку ряда лиц внутри Фронта, желающих избежать повторения ошибок §RБухарина§!. Он стремиться вернуть §GСССР§! былую §Gвоенную славу§!, сделать так, чтобы каждая шестеренка его машины и каждый солдат в его рядах служили делу окончательной победы.\n\nНа другой стороне - §GЖуков§! талантливый, популярный среди граждан полководец, получивший известность в войнах, начиная с §GГражданской§! и заканчивая §RОперацией Суворов§!, в ходе которой он освободил Ворошиловград вместе с §Gмаршалом Момышулом§!. Хотя §GЖуков§! яро предан делу коммунизма, его клика привлекла внимание некоторых реформистов, таких как §GАлександр Яковлев§! и §GНиколай Рыжков§!, а также многих сторонников жесткой линии, не связанных с фракцией Тухачевского, таких как §GСергей Ахромеев§!.\n\nВ нынешнем 1962 году ситуация на §WФронте§! довольно шаткая. За пределами территорий, подконтрольных §GАрхангельску§! лежат §Rгосударства§! под контролем §Rсепаратистов, коллаборационистов, царистов и прочей сволочи§!. Только время покажет, сможет ли §WЗРРФ§! встать во главе Западной России и, возможно, §Gвоссоединить Родину§!, §Gотомстить за павших§!, а также §Gпокарать§! §RГерманию§!.\n\n==ОСОБЕННОСТИ==\n\n*Управляйте враждующими кликами варлордов, чтобы решить будущее §WФронта§!\n\n*Положите конец §Rанархии§!, объединив Россию под §GСоветским знаменем§!\n\n*Готовьтесь к новой §RВеликой Отечественной войне§! против §RГермании§!"

 COUNTRY_INFO_PRC: "§G==THE PEOPLE'S REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL==§!\n\nIn the wake of the West Russian War and the West Russian Revolutionary Front's collapse, Aleksandr Vasilevsky organized the retreat from the Mozhaisk Line. After this defeat Vasilevsky took up the task ensuring the Red Army would survive, no matter what. Gathering all the men that would follow him, Vasilevsky set out to regroup on the Mongolian steppe where the Luftwaffe could not reach them. There Vasilevsky hoped to regroup on the steppe, pushing out from the East to the West. His aim was to avoid the food scarcity and bombing that those who went north with Voroshilov suffer now. Unfortunately, the Imperial Japanese Army was advancing upon these lands already.\n\nWith their collaborators, the Japanese Imperialists would claim all of Mongolia. Would the Red Army abandon the Mongolian people to exploitation and deprivation? Could Vasilevsky rejoin with his brethren in the WRRF if he did so? An uneasy alliance was made with the remnants of the Mongolian Army, the Mongolian and Tuvan people. All would be treated equal by the Red Army, but the Red Army would have primacy over all else. This was the era of warlords and there could be no other compromise in this regard.\n\nAt first the bond of mutual destruction by Imperialists, a mad king, a rogue army, and the madman exploiting Bukharin's legitimacy for his paranoid insanity kept the Revolutionary Council united in purpose. Tensions mount as opportunities now arise to end this period of stagnation. Therefore, the Revolutionary Council has its attention drawn in two directions. The Russians, made up entirely of Red Army veterans, wish to return to their homeland and restore the Soviet order upon the warlords. The Mongolians, who hold solidarity with the Tuvans, desire to push against the puppets of the Sphere. They sense weakness now that Mengjiang is torn apart in open rebellion and see this as the perfect opportunity to unite the nation. If Vasilevsky is to keep the Council whole he must navigate the desires of both groups.\n\nIt will be no easy task. The Russians and Mongolians are both proud peoples. And they have every right to be, for we are unconquered. We are unconquerable! Let us proceed forward, as not a collection of separate peoples, but as a Soviet people!§!\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n*Maintain the interests of the Russian, Mongolian, and Tuvan people.

Reality bears more nuance than can be fit into a propaganda piece.\n\nThe broad brushstrokes are true, of course, like any good bit of misinformation. The §GReich§! had longed for its lost colonies after the Great War, and wrested them back and more after they won the Second. Distinguished pilot and §WReichskommissar Wolfgang Schenck§! has thereafter governed both his home and the erstwhile Portuguese colony of Angola.

Where its jurisdiction is nonexistent in practice flourish a myriad of resistances and united fronts against the colonial menace, biding for the crucial moment their handlers had taught them. Meanwhile, the villagers under their protection wait eagerly for the bird handing gifts from the sky at least once a week.\n\nAt its' apex is §WReichskommissar Schenck§!, a man with a proven record of getting the job done. But that was twenty years ago. Now he spends more time flying his personal craft than in apprising his advisors of this year's plans.

Именно тогда рухнула концепция рузвельтовского "Нового Курса", поскольку сравнения его планов с неудачами Советов и действиями Николая Бухарина сделали подобные планы непопулярными. И тогда §Bдемократами§! был выдвинут §BЭл Смит§!, что позволило тогдашнему действующему президенту §SГерберту Гуверу§! остаться править в Белом доме.\n\nОднако 1936 год полностью поменял положение §MСоединенных Штатов§!, когда §BДжозеф П. Кеннеди§! гарантировал спокойствие и изоляцию от развязанной §Rнацистами§! войны в Европе, игнорируя мольбы Союзников о помощи. Мир и спокойствие царили в Северной Америке, позволяя стране восстанавливаться после Великой депрессии и поддерживать американскую экономику; однако стабильность царила недолго. Настало 7 декабря 1941 года, дата, которая будет вечной памятью о позоре §MСША§!, которые были внезапно атакованы военно-морскими и воздушными силами §xЯпонской Империи§!, потопившими §Mамериканский§! флот на §WПерл-Харбор§!.\n\nВ условиях упадка ВМФ к власти пришёл новый президент §BГарри Трумэн§!, пообещавший американскому народу показать, как "факел свободы прорвется через все преграды". Эти планы моментально испарились в ядерных лучах на Тихом Океане. 4 июля 1945 года яркая вспышка поглотила §YГавайи§! после падения атомной бомбы на многострадальный §WПерл Харбор§!. Что еще хуже, в конце августа было подписано §xСоглашение Агаки§!, официально завершившее войну первым крупным поражением Америки в истории, поскольку оно передавало штат §YГавайи§! и морские базы Лос-Анджелес и Сан-Франциско под контроль §xЯпонии§!. Также США пришлось начать выплачивать огромные репарации и отменить эмбарго для государств, присоединившихся к Оси. Хаотичные выборы 1948 года, приведшие к власти §SТомаса Дьюи§!, стали реквием для §Bдемократов§!, вынужденных искать новые пути в политике в условиях деморализованных §MШтатов§!.

Эйзенхауэр упорно трудился над созданием §TОрганизации Свободных Наций§! - экономического и оборонительного союза демократических сил, оставшихся в мире. Заявление §SЭйзенхауэра§! о намерении вернуть §YГавайи§! обратно в состав §MСША§!, разоравав §xСоглашения Агаки§!, укрепили позиции новой силы внутри страны.

Well, we were almost correct.\n\nAs the Second World War ended, Brittany had not achieved the liberty we had hoped §YHitler§! would grant us. Still under French rule, the future looked bleak. But history has a funny way of giving every cloud a silver lining. The cloud in question was dark purple, and §YHeinrich Himmler§! was the wind. In an ironic twist of fate, Brittany's greatest contemporary existential threat was the very same that caused us to finally gain freedom, as Brittany gained nominal independence in the wake of the formation of §YBurgundy§!.\n\nThough the lot of the Bretons looked to be improving, the world had different plans. As the Reich plummeted into economic chaos, the various client states, Brittany included, were left largely to their fates.

As the New Year's celebrations come to an end, and 1962 begins, the Breton republic looks into the future with eagerness, but also doubts. While the §YBlack Market§! shows much promise for the future of Brittany, Breton intelligence sources indicate that the deteriorating health of §YAdolf Hitler§! is the source of increasing power struggles within Germany.

In this, the §PIndependent Labour Party§! was formed, however it had been on a decline due to the stunning popularity of the §YSNP§!. It looked as if it would dissolve until §PWilliam Wolfe§!, a former member of the §YSNP§! had joined and reformed them into the force they are today. \n\nThe smaller of the three, the §OUnionist Party§! led by §OPriscilla Buchan§! is seen more of a rump party than an actual competitor compared to the juggernaut that is the §YSNP§! and the growing popularity of the §PILP§!. However §OBuchan§! and her party are hopeful for the future. §OBuchan§! herself was a former member of the Conservative Party before arriving in §BScotland§!. After much consideration and funding arriving from a mysterious benefactor, the §OUnionist Party§! was formed. While seen as a laughingstock by both the §YSNP§! and §PILP§!, the §OUP§! is a party full of committed members who have been known for being quite large in attendance at the polling stations with the membership slowly growing. Other elements are at play however, and these may leave a lasting effect on §BScotland§! forever. \n\nOne of the largest figureheads in §BScotland§! is the de facto leader of the §QScottish Armed Forces§!, Marshal §QDouglas Wimberley§!. Loved by his soldiers and the local students of the many colleges and universities of §BScotland§!, he has been known for bringing back dedication and pride into the many subjects he likes. Being one of the other founders of the current republic, he has quite the public image. To his more closest friends and advisors, they know that Wimberley can be a paranoid man. While all may seem well to the citizens of §BScotland§!, the Armed Forces are in a constant state of alert. With the §RCollaborators§! on the border, the threat of attack is constant. This ideal has been drilled into the §QArmed Forces§! and is something that the generals and admirals live by. §QWimberley§! is a smart man and will put it on the line to protect Scottish independence and freedom as he sees it.\n\n==FEATURES==\n\nDecide the future of §BScotland using§! the Election GUI and Mechanics.\n\n Balance the §QScottish Armed Forces§! with the Paranoia Mechanic.\n\nReunite the British Isles and save §REngland§! from the §RCollaborators.§!"

Perhaps then it is inevitable that they would be subjected to the same depredations they inflicted on a thousand nations at the hands of §gGermany§!. §xEngland§! in this new and untested era is not the same place as it once was, for instead of the traditional power structures it is lead by a loose alliance of all those who want no more war with the Reich. The §gRoyal Party§!. Under §gAlec Douglas-Home§! the party has recovered greatly from the miserable days of the war and the chaos following the 1953 London Uprising by communist revolutionaries. §gHome§! leads the §gModerate§! faction of the RP, the largest portion of the coalition dedicated more to stability than any true ideals beyond that. At his side is §zHarold Macmillan§! and the §zReformists§!, who nominally adhere to democratic principles but are willing to compromise with §gHome§! for the good of §xEngland§!. Also present are the §OHardliners§!, dedicated fascists led by §OArthur Kenneth Chesterton§! who advocate for a state closer to the German model.

But recovery doesn't meant stability, for another faction exists within §xEngland§!, §eHMMLR§!. \n\nHer Majesty's Most Loyal Resistance is a network of several different rebel groups all answering to one unknown man, allegedly called "the Boss". The organisation itself can be traced back to the aftermath of the 2nd World War, but it wasn't until the defeat and nigh annihilation of the Communist Party of Great Britain at the Third Battle of Cable Street that §eHMMLR§! rose to the fore of the English rebel organisations. §eHMMLR§! proper are dedicated to the return of the person they believe is the rightful monarch of §xEngland§!, Queen Elizabeth II. A somewhat conservative organisation, it is surprising that they allied with the second largest faction, The §RLeft Resistance§!. Led by §RBill Alexander§!, a veteren of the West Russian War, Spanish Civil War and a dozen wars in between, along with being one of the few notable survivors of Third Cable Street, The §RLeft Resistance§! are an eclectic mix of communists, socialists and even most of the old Labour Party united under a common banner and cause. The third piece of the puzzle can be found in §GDavid Stirling§! and his §GCommando's§!. The only rebel group to be in active rebellion from the end of the 2nd World War when he deserted, §GStirling's§! §GCommando's§! are the smallest of the three major parts of §eHMMLR§! but also the best trained and equipped. What sets them apart from their brethren however is their fierce republicanism and an unquenchable desire for vengeance upon the traitors to §xEngland§!. \n\nThese two factions will eventually have to face off, though in what circumstances and when remains to be seen.

He stepped in between the King and the Duce's political rivalry, convincing his father-in-law to forfeit the struggle to end the monarchy; some say the Duce's death some days later was a mere coincidence, some say §GCiano§! took the safety of §GItaly§! into his own hands.

But circumstance and stubbornness allowed the §GIrish§! to have a state of their own once more, and for a time it seemed as though peace would be the way of things between the §REnglish§! and their §Gformer subject§!. Then, the §qGerman Reich§! attacked. Through Warsaw, Paris and even London itself did the German boot march, and §YEamon de Valera§!, Prime Minister, leader of §LFianna Fáil§! and the Irish Hero, was faced with the choice of siding with a §Rdoomed power§! or making §Gthe republic's§! place in the §gnew world order§! assured through blood.\n\nThe §Yde Valera§! administration authorised the §GIrish§! invasion with §gGerman§! assistance, of the region known as §ONorthern Ireland§!, the only part of the §Gemerald Isle§! kept under §SBritish rule§!. On the back of a successful albeit bloody campaign and long, §LFianna Fáil§! hasn't merely come to dominate §GIrish§! politics over the past decades but in effect become the sole ruling party. §cFine Gael§! has withered on the vine, whilst the socialist §eSinn Féin§! was banned outright. Yet not everyone is content with the state of affairs, especially §GIrish§! membership in the German dominated §qEinheitspakt§!. Following the Withdrawal of the German garrisons from Northern Counties at the time of the West Russian War, control over the §ONorthern Counties§! Became increasingly difficult, necessitating the appointment of  §YNeil Blaney§! as Minister for the Northern Counties. Trough methods unknown to much of the government, he has maintained the boiling pot that is the region under control.\n\n§LFF§! dominance waned during the tumultuous times of the 50's, and whilst §Yde Valera§! is well liked by the average Irishman there are many who began to tire of his rule as once small mistakes began to pile up slowly but surely. Thus when §LSeán Lemass§! suggested that §Yde Valera§! take the more ceremonial position of the presidency where he could retain influence still, it was a trivial issue for the old man to accept, though he cautioned §LLemass§! not to coalition with §SLabour§!. It must have come as an unpleasant surprise to the elderly revolutionary when the new Prime Minister did exactly that and formed the current government as a §LFF§!-§SLabour§! coalition, with de Valera powerless to stop it. And in the midst of this disagreement §LFF§! has started to show even more vulnerability than before.\n\nNow after a disappointingly narrow victory in the '61 elections, three factions of §LFF§! stand to contest the parties future. The §LDe Valerists§!, supporters of the conservative old guard and §YLemass§!'s support base. The §qHardliners§! of the aforementioned§YNeil Blaney§!, catholic supremacists who are disliked fervently by the north, and §YJack Lynch§!'s awkwardly named §TLiberals§!. Who despite having little in common with the ideology are nonetheless the most reform minded of §LFF§!.\n\nWhile these factions spatter over mundane politics, the situation in the §ONorthern Counties§!, the largely protestant former British territories, continues to degrade. Few have taken well to §YNeil Blaney§!'s governance, and terrorism is rife from §OUlster§! to §ODerry§!. Three factions continue to gather strength under the noses of Dublin: The newest amongst these is the §GReal Irish Republican Army§!, a secretive splinter group of the old IRA, which is known to be aligned with the interest of Germany. There is also §eSaor Éire§!, also known by its less used name, the Old IRA, an alliance of Irish nationalist and socialist groups opposed to German interference, and led by Seamus Twomey. Finally, there is the §JUlster Volunteer Force§!, a force opposed equally to Irish and German rule, led by the popular presbysterian preacher, §OIan Paisely.§!\n\nNow in 1962 §GIreland§! has a future uncertain set before it, one can say it has two visions for it: Fianna Fáil's vision of status quo and stability or the vision of change of Fine Gael. Only good governance and luck could save a nation so economically dominated by the interests of the §gReich§! and so politically torn on the inside. But perhaps the world will find a way to bring this about.\n\n§G==FEATURES==§!\n\n* Manage §LFianna Fáil§!'s inner affairs through all the means possible to avoid the worst things possible or finally bring §lchange§! to the country's political life.\n\n* Lift §GIreland§! out of poverty without running out of budget and the investors's trust.\n\n* Handle the ticking bomb that is §ONorthern Ireland§! as wisely as you can."

 REGIONAL_INFO_WEST_RUSSIA: "§G==ЗАПАДНАЯ РОССИЯ==§!\n\nКогда §GСоветский Союз§! Бухарина рухнул, немцы уже праздновали победу над Россией. В самом сердце страны, на базе ее крупнейшего города, был создан Рейхскомиссариат Московия. Слабая и трусливая Красная Армия исчезла в небытие, а немцы продолжили строить свою тысячелетнюю империю на костях большевистского государства.\n\nНо §RЗападнорусская война§! оказалась сюрпризом для Берлина. Внезапное наступление §GЗападнорусского революционного фронта§! растянулось на тысячи километров, продвижением командовал §GВеликий маршал Ворошилов§! совместно с некоторыми из лучших генералов бывшего союза: §GГеоргем Жуковым§! и §GМихаилом Тухачевским§!. Советские войска сильно потеснили самодовольных немцев и смогли прорвать их линию обороны по нескольким направлениям. На мгновение показалось, что Рейхскомиссариат Московия вот-вот падет...\n\nНо чуда не произошло, §RЗападнорусская Война§! обернулась трагедией. Теперь в §GЗРРФ§! понимают чего стоила им попытка реванша: некоторые лица начали сотрудничать с Рейхом; атака показала некомпетентность самого Фронта; вскрылись факты предстательства со стороны §WСыктывкара§!. Кроме того, немцам помогали коллаборационисты: люди, поддерживающие имперского претендента §WВладимира III§! и так называемая §GРусская Освободительная Армия§! §WАндрея Власова§!. Со временем, фронт был сдвинут назад, а впоследствии развалился. Но вне зависимости от провала Союза, §RВермахт§! все равно очень большой ценой смог дать отпор Красной армии.\n\nТеперь же Западная Россия находится в заглохшем состоянии, многочисленные варлорды топчутся на месте, пока их города с четкой регулярностью §Rбомбят самолеты Люфтваффе§!. На севере под §GАрхангельском§! сохранились остатки ЗРРФ. Ожидается, что скоро стареющий Великий Маршал Ворошилов выберет себе преемника; его наиболее вероятными кандидатами являются маршалы Тухачевский и Жуков. Назначенные для управления военными округами Плесецка и Ухты, командиры пока что не успели влиться в политику самого Архангельска. К югу находится §GРеспублика Коми§!, демократия, рожденная из сепаратистской провинции Фронта. Президент Вознесенский достойно управлял молодой нацией, однако растущая политическая нестабильность создаваемая крайне левыми и крайне правыми популистами угрожает республике. Тем не менее у Коми есть несколько собственных козырей, так что она может стать одним из главных претендентом на объединение всего региона.\n\nЮжнее Фронта и западнее Коми расположилась §GВологда, Кострома и Горький§!. Когда-то фронтовики, вологодские военные, взбунтовались узнав о продолжении борьбы с русскими солдатами. С тех пор они пытаются вести очень опасную дипломатическую игру, в этом им помогает богатство Костромы. Этот город-государство является важным торговым узлом черного рынка Германии. Последний член тройки отколовшихся провинций, город Горький, является домом для некоторых танкистов-ветеранов. Изолированные от своих бывших командиров, люди здесь превратились в бандитов и налетчиков.\n\nЕще южнее можно найти §GВятку и Самару§!, отошедшие немецкими коллаборационистами в последний день §RЗападнорусской войны§!. Оба региона надеются использовать свои опытные армейские подразделения для обеспечения контроля над Западной Россией. Монархистов в §GВятке§! сдерживает императорское правление, возглавляемое законным наследником Романовых Владимиром III. В это время, у их соперников в §GСамаре§! ни осталось ничего, кроме собственного оружия. Презираемые почти всеми за помощь немцам, жители территорий подконтрольных Русской Освободительной Армии, неуверенные в навязанных им целях, оказались отрезаны от своих семей на Западе.\n\nОстальные же новообразованные государства просто стараются выжить в пепле и руинах, созданных бесконечными немецкими бомбардировками. Например в §GБашкирии и в Татарстане§! местное население по-разному относится к возобновлению новой войны в России, в большинстве случаев, надеясь, что надвигающиеся конфликты обойдут их стороной. В §WОнеге§! люди §GАнтикоммунистической Добровольческой Гвардии§! продолжают свой бесконечный дозор. Они вынуждены служить для Финской республики стеной между их новыми землями в Карелии и русской анархией. Ветра войны поднимаются в России. И если разрушительные бомбардировки прекратятся, то возникнут новые конфликты за установление господства в Западной России, которые и решат будущую судьбу России.\n\n§G==ОСОБЕННОСТИ==§!\n\n*Положите конец эпохе варлордов и объедините Западную Россию под своим флагом\n\n*Используйте свое многочисленное население и мощную промышленную базу как плацдарм для объединения России\n\n*Готовьтесь вернуть у Германии оккупированные русские земли"

Тем не менее, несмотря на та, что Республика существует почти два десятилетия, она испытывает трудности со стабильностью: ее раздирают националисты, юнионисты и другие партии.

Еще одна потенциальная проблема может быть связана и с их делами на международном рынке.

Помогая немцам в их завоевании §oСеверной Ирландии§! во время Второй мировой войны, они лишились всех дипломатических друзей, которые находили вне §gОси§!. Однако, поскольку ситуация в Европе становится все более нестабильной, будущее Изумрудного острова остается неопределенным, и, возможно, на его судьбу повлияет тот, кто одержит победу в Британии. Ирландский народ известен тем, что не сдается даже в самых худших ситуация, так или иначе англичане проверят эту присказку первыми, когда придет время объединения.\n\nБритания - это и страна хаоса, и страна возможностей.

Будучи отцом для своих людей и обладая мощной армией, он все же остается относительно аполитичным. На юге, обнимая Пустоши Казахстана, спит чудовище Великой Злобы. Спартанский город §RОмск§! протягивает свою костлявую хватку через всю Западную Сибирь, объединяя людей, чьи имена вызывают страх. Как шахматист §RЧёрная Лига§! просчитывает каждый свой шаг и шепотом напоминает людям о смерти.n\nНа вершине высоких гор стоит §Yкупеческая Республика Златоуст§!. Правители этого Эльдорадо стоят на крупнейшем военно-производственном комплексе России. Торговцы смертью помогают вооружать армии по обе стороны баррикад, что возможно и приведет к их собственной гибели. Но республика также является домом для новаторов, а ее стабильность и справедливость привлекают множество беженцев. Новые винтовки сыплются с современных сборочных конвейеров, нло любой, кто захочет заполучить эти сокровища, должен сначала попробовать пробиться. Но Златоуст не одинок, здесь жа на севере образовалась §WВоровская территория Югры§!. Страна без законов, управляемая бандитами и головорезами, Югра проводит постоянные рейды за продовольствием и боеприпасами.\n\nУ берегов северных морей расположилась §WВоркута§!, управляемая остатками Воркутинского Исправительно-трудового лагеря. Один из крупнейших §RГУЛАГОВ§! в России, его узники мерзнут и питаются объедками. Последняя группировка в этом регионе - §WВольные Авиаторы§!, остатки советского воздушного корпуса. Уникальные по своему устройству, авиаторы не имеют действующего правительства - скорее, они представляют собой сеть аэродромов, последнюю линию обороны от бесконечного натиска Люфтваффе. Авиаторы пользуются уважением со стороны всех фракций, в то время, как их число уменьшается с каждым днем воздушных боев. Однако ходят слухи о неминуемой смерти Гитлера и крахе пакта, что остановит террористические бомбардировки, проложив путь к войне за национальное возрождение.n\n§G==ОСОБЕННОСТИ==§!\n\n*Мобилизуйте промышленность и соберите свои армии, чтобы восстановить Западную Сибирь, либо под красным флагом, либо под Черной Лигой\n\n*Используйте превосходную промышленность, чтобы завоевать Западную Россию, но не забывайте и о Южном Урале\n\n*Подготовьтесь к неизбежной войне против Германии"

 REGIONAL_INFO_CENTRAL_SIBERIA: "§G==ЦЕНТРАЛЬНАЯ СИБИРЬ==§!\n\nКогда то в Центральной Сибири было мощное государство §WЦентрально-Сибирская Республика§!. Весь мир следил за действиями §WТомска§!, столицей этого государства: молодая нация стойко преодолевала все невзгоды. Под контролем у республики был самый большой промышленный сектор страны, образовавшийся здесь в результате Бухаринских проектов по модернизации Центральной Сибири. ЦСР была наиболее вероятным кандидатом на объединения России\n\nНо мирные дни длились совсем недолго. В конце концов Центральную Сибирь погубил не немецкий фашизм, а неспособность русских работать сообща. Внутренние распри и иностранное вторжение сломили хребет Центрально-Сибирской республике, оставив на месте могущественной страны уйму мелких гособразований.\n\nТак на юго-западе образовалась §Wфедерация Новосибирска и Барнаула§!, которая планирует использовать свои сельскохозяйственные угодья и тяжелую промышленность для воссоединения региона. Недалеко от них - хунта легендарного летчика-аса §WПокрышкина§!, который лично следили за развалом старой республики. И теперь он планируют не повторять ее ошибок. К востоку от Федерации можно найти §WЦарство Кемерово§!, возглавляемое §WЦарем Рюриком II§!. Маленькое государство смешивает в себе средневековую Русь и современный социализм, путая многих международных экспертов. И если некоторые описывают §WРюрика II§! как безумного старого дурака, то другие отмечают, что он отлично управляет государством, подготавливая армию для будущих событий.\n\nК востоку от §WЦарства§!, можно найти еще одно образование во главе с бывшим генералом ЦСР в Красноярске. Здесь стоит шаткая демократия, будущее которой покрыто туманом, но никто не отрицает, что §WНиколай Андреев§! и его товарищи будут сражаться до смерти для сохранения своей независимости. К югу от §WКемерова§! можно найти горное §WКаракорумское правительство Ойротии§!. Отрезанные от центральной власти §WЦСР§! малочисленные народы Алтая и старообрядческие беженцы объединились в стремлении избежать кровопролития и притеснений за свои религиозные убеждения.\n\nК востоку от §WКрасноярска§! раскинулось множество сел и вольных городов. Однако это не покинутая территория, здесь властвует §WCибирская Чёрная Армия§!. Приверженцы особого милитаризованного варианта анархизма, руководство §WЧерной Армии§! строят планы своих следующих действий. Их генералы заявляют, что вся Россия должна быть освобождена от государственного гнета, начиная с Центральной Сибири.\n\nНаконец, на севере рухнувшей §WЦСР§! находится город Томск и обширные арктические просторы. Многие считают это пристанище художников и мыслителей несостоятельным местом, люди здесь страдают от упадка и неспособности смириться с потерей большей части своей армии после всех расколов и восстаний. Тем не менее, §WПрезидент-поэт Пастернак§! не сдается. Перед своей смертью пожилой лидер планирует передать бразды правления новой политической элите, способной воссоединить §WЦентрально-Сибирскую Республику§!.\n\nВойны на истощение с §RРоссийским Дальним Востоком§! и другие долгие конфликты породили в Центральной Сибири государства варлордов. Однако место здесь есть только для одного военачальника, одного наследника мощной Бухаринской промышленности. Борьба за литейные заводы и фабрики советской эпохи вызовут еще большее кровопролитие! Грядет эпоха новых объединительных войн.\n\n§G==ОСОБЕННОСТИ==§!\n\n*§WОбъедините§! богатый Центрально-Сибирский регион и используйте его как плацдарм для объединения России\n\n*§WУправляйте§! своей долей в промышленности Центральной Сибири, расширяя ее и решая вопросы прав рабочих по мере того, как накаляются региональные конфликты""

 REGIONAL_INFO_FAR_EAST: "§G==ДАЛЬНИЙ ВОСТОК==§!\n\n§WДальний Восток§! безусловно является наименее населенным из российских регионов. Здесь, из-за коварного климата и враждебного ландшафта, люди буквально борются за выживание. Трагический крах §GСоветского Союза§! мало повлиял на положение дел в этой суровой области. Данная земля стала пристанищем для разномастных варлордов, каждый из которых стремится подчинить своей воле всю страну.\n\nТак, после краха Союза, §GГенрих Ягода§! бежал сюда с остатками Советского Президиума и восстановил "красный" режим в окрестностях §WИркутска§!. Он утвердил железное господство над регионом и начал вступать в конфликты с соседними военачальниками, такими как §RЦентральная Сибирская Республика§!. Однако его правление над областью продлилось недолго, произошла другая непредвиденная катастрофа.\n\nВ регион вторглись темные силы из маньчжурского города §WХарбин§!, они пересекли Амур, двинулись на север, начав кровавый крестовый поход против §RБольшевизма§!. §GКонстантин Родзаевский§! и его §GРоссийская фашистская партия§! стали острием этого вторжения, которое сильно ослабило влияние Ягоды на Востоке. Нападавшие установили свой режим в Зее и других ближайших городах. Однако вскоре и сам Родзаевский столкнулся с огромными проблемаи.\n\nУмеренная фракция из РФП во главе с §GМихаил Матковский§! с отвращением относились к Родзаевскому и его постоянному восхвалению §Rнацистских захватчиков§!. Возмущение в рядах партии только росло, и достигло апогея в момент взятия Раскольниками ключевого порта §GМагадан§!. Почувствовав удачный момент, остатки §GБелой Армии§!, помогавшие РФП, отняли у Родзаевского свою старую цитадель - город §WЧиту§!. Здесь они начали вести свою политику во главе с собственным претендентом на императорский престол, неким §GМихаилом II§!. Белое движение планирует любыми средствами восстановить монархию в России.\n\nМежду тем, последний удар по правлению §GЯгоды§! нанес внезапный мятеж внутри его армии. Бывший офицер НКВД §GВалерий Саблин§!, молодой и идеалистичный революционер, захватил власть над §WБурятией§!, объявив войну Ягоде и Президиуму. По состоянию на 1962 год этот конфликт все еще продолжается, и пока нельзя точно назвать победителя.\n\nНо хуже всего на севере региона, здесь царит абсолютная анархия. Очень немногие остались жить в этом арктическом аду, и вряд ли здесь появится сильное государство. Тем не менее, среди племен и деревень на севере ходят слухи о §Gмогущественной фигуре§!, которая сможет воссоединить нацию...\n\n§WРоссийский Дальний Восток§! это безлюдный и пропитанная кровью земля. Нелюдимый регион вряд ли начнет развиваться, пока не объединиться под флагом одного из государств.\n\n§G==ОСОБЕННОСТИ==§!\n\n*Защитите последние остатки Советского Союза или полностью уничтожьте большевистское государствоn\n*С аккуратностью пользуйтесь теми скудными ресурсами, которые предоставляет эта пустынная земляn\n*Остерегайтесь нападения с §WСевера§!"

Этот город даже в нынешние темные времена, оставаясь опасным местом, все же олицетворяет великие возможности русского народа. Немного севернее находится §WУральская Лига§!, здесь правят военизированные сыны Воркуты - объединившееся в 50-ых годах охранники и заключенные лагерей, которые посвятили себя защите бедных и нуждающихся России.\n\nК югу же стоит §WБригада Дирлевангера§! - подлые бандиты, участвовавшие плечом к плечу с §RНемцами§! в §WЗападнорусской Войне§!.

Царствующий над миром §WРейх§! не оставил §YЧёрный Континент§! нетронутым: лапы Германии выкопали целое море в сердце Африки, а сам доминион находится под жёстким контролем немцов. Две тысячи миль земли - от края до края - всё это владения §WРейха§!. Но славные годы империи подходят к концу. Её костлявая хватка ослабевает с каждым днём, парализуя Зал Народа.\n\nНе весь континент пал перед фашистскими захватчиками. На самом краю расположился непокорный §WЮжно-Африканский Союз§!, один из последних доменов старой империи, некогда простиравшийся здесь от Кейптауна до Каира. Но после окончания войны, очевидно, что дела у Союза - плохи как никогда; Намибия вырвана из его рук, а собственный народ в расколот на три части. Последняя африканская демократия медленно увядает под давлением сепаратизма, восстаний и угроз интервенции. Тем не менее, граждане Союза уверенно охраняют границы, они готовы с отвагой встретить смерть, защищая свой дом.\n\nС севера им угрожает триумвират самых могущественных и влиятельных людей Африки: §YРейхскомиссары Вольфганг Шенк§!, §YЗигфрид Мюллер§! И §YГанс Хюттиг§!, правители ровных частей Миттельафриканской территории Рейха.

Вы можете ознакомиться с финансовой сводкой страны кликнув по §Wзначку доллара§! между иконками §Wпроизводства§! и §Wстроительства§!. Здесь вы увидите свой §GВВП§!, который является основным показателем экономки нации. Ваш §GВВП§! должен уравновешивать §Rгосударственный долг§!. §RЗадолженность§! постоянно растет так, как к ней начисляются проценты. Если ваша §Rдолговая обязанность§! превысит §GВВП§!, то это может привести к финансовому краху.\n\nДабы избежать экономических проблем, внимательно следите за вашими §Gдоходами§! и §Yрасходами§!. §GПрибыль§! государства определяется множеством факторов, наиболее очевидным из которых является §GВВП§!. Однако играют роль и другие условия, такие как ваша промышленность, уровень бедности, научное развитие страны и многое другое. Но не забывайте, что у вас есть и §Yрасходы§!, проклятие любого экономиста. §YИздержки§! начисляются из-за содержания войска, реализации соцполитики, строительства проектов и так далее.\n\nИграя в §WThe New Order§! всегда держите в уме принцип баланса. Безрассудные §Yтраты§! могут быстро раздуть §Rгосдолг§!, который со временем станет причиной дефолта и §Rэкономического краха§!. С другой стороны, тщательно и грамотно выстроенная финансовая политика приводит к высокому уровню §GВВП§!, крупным денежным резервам и светлому будущему вашей нации.\n\n§Y==НОВЫЕ МЕХАНИКИ==§!\nМногие страны в §WTNO§! имеют свои уникальные игровые механики, с которыми можно взаимодействовать через расширенный §Gпользовательский интерфейс§!. Таким образом в моде было осуществлено углубление §Rгеймплея§!, нацеленное на увеличение интерактивности игры в мирное время. Например, вы сможете напрямую влиять на работу §WТомской Думы§!, следить за §WЮжноафриканским Референдумом§! и выполнять §Rдругие§! интересные задачи. §GВкладки с новыми функциями§! встроены непосредственно на страницу §Yрешений§!, чтобы получить доступ к ним, просто кликньте на соотвествующую эконку в верхнем меню.\n\nТакже в игре представлены и более серьезные §Gмеханики§!, за которыми можно следить через вкладку §Yполитика§!. На данной странице, при игре за определенные нации, вы заметите новую кнопку, которая будет расположена под портретом §Wлидера вашей страны§!, рядом с иконкой §Wглавы правительства§!. При открытии данной вкладки вы увидите §Gполностью новый игровой элемент§!, который будет отражать более глубокие и важные для §Rигры за выбранное государство§! интерактивные функции. Сюда входят уникальные интерфейсы §Wвыборов в США§!, §WЦольферайна Шпеера§!, §Wпарламента Японии§! и §Rнесколько§! других стран. Отметим, у большинства §Gтаких игровых компонентов§! есть кнопка §Yинфо§!, которая при §Rнаведении указателя мыши или нажатии на нее§!, отображает полезную информацию о том, как работает та или иная §Rвстроенная функция§!.\n\n§Y==КРУПНОМАСШТАБНАЯ ВОЙНА==§!\n§RВойна§! - перманентное явление ​​в мире §WНового Порядка§!, именно поэтому мы почти полностью переработали систему юнитов Hearts of Iron IV. В нашем проекте под руководством игрока находятся армии времён холодной войны, вследствие чего, теперь при наземных операция вы можете положиться на вертолёты и армейскую авиацию, которая упростит нападение и переброску войск. §RВоздушной кавалерии§! посвящены и новые ветки технологий. Бронетехника в моде заиграет новыми красками, ведь на полях боя главенствуют §GОБТ§!, также вы можете открыть для своей армии целый набор современных танков. Однако игрокам не стоит забывать о пехоте и механизированных подразделениях. Броня и авиация - не замена ботинкам на земле!\n\nВ это же время моря бороздят новые военные судна. Нынешние технологии позволили §Rсовременным авианосцам и кораблям-невидимкам§! выйти в океан. Переделанная военно-морские ветка техов TNO отлично отражает динамичный характер конфликтов времён холодной войны. Кроме того, игрок сможет развивать новые модели бомбардировщиков и истребителей, которые органично вписываются в мир Нового Порядка.\n\nНо самое важное решение, с которым должен определиться игрок, - это выбор §Военных доктрин§!. Изматывающие сражения с партизанами изменили представление о войнах. Блиц Второй мировой войны остался в прошлом, его заменили долгие подготовительные работы на территории противника. Завоевание городов врага больше не гарантирует победы над ним, и боевой путь игрока должен отражать это. §RПравила войны§! изменились, а вместе с ними и войска. Кстати, мы также добавили в игру §Wтысячи новых генералов§!, чтобы вы смогли правильно распределить обязанности среди ваших вооруженных сил."
 
 MOD_FEATURES_TEXT_2:0 "§R==ВЗАИМНОЕ ГАРАНТИРОВАННОЕ УНИЧТОЖЕНИЕ==§!\nДействие мода §WThe New Order: Last Days of Europe§! происходит во времена холодной войны. К 1962 году атомное оружие появилось у §WСША§!, §WГермании§!, и §WЯпонии§, совместно они образовали §Rядерную триаду§!. Остальные же нации боятся лишний раз проявлять признаки агрессии, опасаясь начала §Rядерного холокоста§!.\n\nПо сути, многие страны находятся в подчинении у §Gсверхдержав§!, настроенных против друг против друга, но не имеющих возможности быстро завоевать победу. Любая война между §Gсверхдержавами§! неизбежно приведёт к §RТретьей мировой войне§!.\n\n§RТретья мировая война§! не сулит ничего хорошего. Стороны будут сражаться до тех пор, пока одно из государств не начнёт колебаться. Если нация чувствует, что она вот-вот рухнет без возможностей продолжать войну или её территории находятся под серьезной угрозой, то она обязательно применит §Rядерное оружие§!. Первый атомный удар станет опрокинувшейся костяшкой в этом апокалиптическом домино, тысячи единиц ядерного оружия будут задействованы за считанные дни. Если это произойдёт, то ваша §Rигра закончится§!! К счастью, дипломатию никто не отменял. §RЯдерная война§! - явление крайне редкое. Атомное оружие - это инструмент давления, а не прямого сражения. Вы можете следить за §Rмировой напряжённостью§! в специальной строке §WDEFCON§ в правом верхнем углу. Показатель §WDEFCON§!, часов судного дня, демонстрирует, насколько высоко поднят уровень глобальных войн. Чем он выше, тем больше вероятность того, что дипломатические варианты станут неэффективны. На уровне §WDEFCON 1§!, война станет неизбежностью. \n\n§Y==ПРОКСИ-ВОЙНЫ==§!\nКак и говорилось ранее, война в мире §WНового порядка§! - не редкость. Жаркие бои здесь ведутся §Gв каждом регионе§!, вы и сами непременно будете сражаться с несколькими нациями. Однако боевые действия обычно проходят не в виде прямого противостояния, а принимают форму §Rпрокси-войн§!. §RОпосредованные войны§! проходят между двумя сторонами при поддержке более крупных государств. Так вы можете бороться с кем-то, не вступая в открытый бой. Это может происходить, например, во время §Rгражданских войн§!, которые также будут вспыхивать довольно часто.\n\nВо время §Rпрокси-войны§! нации, враждующие друг с другом, могут получить серьёзную поддержку извне. Если война идёт без внешней помощи, то сражающаяся нациия получит в дар несколько юнитов. Если же игрок вмешается в конфликт, то он сможет поддержать свою сторону через §Wсистему добровольцев§! как это и было в ванильной версии §WHearts of Iron IV§!.\n\nОднако будьте осторожны! Прокси-войны - опасная авантюра, они могут быстро увеличить уровень §WDEFCON§!! §R'Дипломатический кризис'§! может стать следствием такой агрессивной политики, и иногда. Помните, одно неверное движение - и мир испарится в огне глобальной катастрофы.\n\n§Y==ДИПЛОМАТИЧЕСКИЕ КРИЗИСЫ==§!\n§RДипломатические кризисы§! могут возникать в любой момент по ходу развития крупномасштабных конфликтов или §Rпрокси-войн§!. Такой §Rмеждународный кризис§! представляет из себя цепочку событий, которые подпитывают рост мировой напряжённости, что в результате может перерасти в глобальную войну. Обычно кризис происходит сперва у одного из §Wчастников§! войны, это открывает нации возможность либо рискнуть и надавить на другую державу, чтобы та вышла из войны, либо отступить, ослабив напряжённость. Если вы продолжите участвовать в конфликте, то у обороняющегося государства появится такие же возможности решения кризиса. Такое перебрасывание "любезностями" может продолжаться некоторое время, при этом награда увеличивается с каждым шагом, но также растут и контрибуции в случае проигрыша. Если ни одна из сторон не уступит, то §Rэто создаст повод для войны между обеими нациями!§!\n\n§RДипломатические кризисы§! будут возникать чаще при высоких уровнях §WDEFCON§!, но они также будут происходить и в мирное время! Вам решать: либо решайте вопрос дипломатией, либо пользуйтесь ситуацией, чтобы разжечь конфликт...\n\n§G==ПОВЕСТВОВАНИЕ==§!\n§WThe New Order§!, как и его демо, опираются на §Gатмосферное повествование§!. Это означает, что мод концентрирует внимание на сюжете больше, чем на любой другой части геймплея §WHearts of Iron IV§!\n\nИз этого следует, что игровые циклы §GHOI 4§! и §WTNO§! серьёзно различаются. В моде исчезает традиционный процесс подготовки к войнам с возможностью выбора идеологии перед конфликтом, со случайным ивентами, дающие вам небольшие бонусы. Вместо этого вы будете руководить страной, как будто вы проходите §W'екстовый квест§!. Конечно, вы успеете и повоевать, но самое главное, это то, как вы реагируете на внутриигровые ситуации. Кроме того, у многих наций есть свои уникальные механики, которые нужно изучать по ходу прохождения. В конечном итоге вы словно будете вершить историю в интерактивной форме.\n\nПоэтому, пожалуйста, откиньтесь на спинку кресла, расслабьтесь и наслаждайтесь сюжетом. Проведите свою страну по сложному пути! Мы постарались сделать так, чтобы вы всегда могли понять, в какую сторону развивается ваша нация. Если вы чувствуете, что заблудились, то сообщите нам об этом. Однако мы не ожидаем, что вы столкнётесь с особыми проблемами, так что наслаждайтесь игрой!"
